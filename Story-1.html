            <h1>Building Tech MasterMind, My Journey and Vision</h1>
            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Himanshu Seervi, the founder of <u>Tech MasterMind</u>.</p>
                <p>I'm a university student entering my second year in September 2024, studying software engineering in
                    Canada. I used to have two businesses, one was a marketing agency offering short-form content and
                    the other was an AI Automation Agency. My marketing agency was running pretty well, making around
                    <u>$500-$700</u> per month. I know it's not a lot, üòÇ.
                </p>
                <h3>A little bit about me:</h3>
                <p>While I am building Tech MasterMind, I am also working my first internship at a Steel Factory as an
                    IT student.</p>
                <h3>What is Tech MasterMind?</h3>
                <p>It's a website where I will interview a bunch of <strong>techpreneurs and software engineers</strong>
                    to share their journey on how they become successful and share some advice for someone who wants to
                    do the same.</p>
                <p>I want to interview techpreneurs, basically founders who started a tech/software company, to see how
                    they got started.</p>
                <p>I also want to interview a bunch of <u>9-5 developers</u> on how they landed their first job and
                    their journey up to this point.</p>
                <p>I feel like there are a lot of myths going around the world. The first being that working a 9-5 job
                    is running your life and the second being that it is impossible to get a <u>CS internship</u> in
                    this job market. Now, even I think that getting an internship in this job market is hard, well, at
                    least in Canada.</p>
                <p>This is why I want to interview developers so that current CS students, like me, can have a
                    <u>blueprint to follow</u>, giving themselves a higher chance than others. And as for the first
                    myth, yeah, I don‚Äôt believe that (The effect of social media and how it has changed how we think).
                </p>
                <h3>Challenges:</h3>
                <p>I only worked on this project for 3 days and encountered a few challenges that I need to overcome.
                    The first challenge is finding people to interview. I've sent some cold emails, but the main issue
                    is finding suitable interviewees. I've used YouTube and blogs as a starting point, but I need to
                    come up with a better plan. The second problem is centering a button on my website üòÇü§®.
                </p>
                <h3>How I came up with this idea? Why is this a good idea?</h3>
                <p>So as I mentioned before that I am going into second year and many students, including myself, start
                    working on side projects to add to their portfolios. When I opened VSCode I had no idea what I
                    wanted to build, so I went on YouTube to do some research. That's when I came across Pat Walls,
                    founder of <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/" target="_blank">Starter Story.</a> I was already
                    familiar with Pat and rewatched one of his videos on
                    <u><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_wEmB5MapE"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">"How I Built A $1M Business From This
                            Starbucks"</a></u> and he says ‚ÄúI can
                    turn these questions into a product‚Äù, which sparked the idea for something similar to Starter Story.
                </p>
                <p>This led to the creation of <u>Tech MasterMind</u>, inspired by Starter Story but with my own unique
                    twist. I then had the thought of creating something to guide current CS students, like me, in the
                    right direction and also inspire entrepreneurs to start their own tech companies.</p>
                <p>Now here is the best part I can showcase this project on my portfolio, making it look impressive
                    since I've created something that aims to solve a problem. It's a <strong>win-win</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Monthly Goal:</h3>
                <p>I got the idea to start Tech MasterMind on July 23, 2024, and I'm writing this on the 26th, so
                    there's not much time left this month. My main goal for this month is to complete the development of
                    the website, deploy it online, and post at least 3 blogs. I also aim to set up Google Analytics,
                    although I'm not sure how to do this. I'll hopefully be able to figure it out by searching online.
                </p>
                <p>I‚Äôll keep you guys posted see you next month and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe by putting your email
                    below.</p>
                <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
